# Project Kickoff

This project generates a printable, interactive curriculum using Vue 3 + TypeScript. It computes visual summaries from experience data, such as skill usage, industry presence, and roles over time.

## üß∞ Requirements

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)  
- NVM (optional, but recommended for version management)  
- SSH access with public key to deploy (optional for deployment)

## üì¶ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## üöÄ Development Server

Launch the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üèóÔ∏è Production Build

Generate a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: There was a typo in the original command: `buld` ‚ûú `build`.

## üöö Deploy via SSH

You can deploy the built files to a remote server via SSH.

> This requires your public SSH key to be installed on the destination server.

```bash
./deploy.sh [user]@domain.com /path/on/remote/server
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

Key folders:

- `src/assets/fonts` ‚Äî Embedded fonts  
- `src/assets/images` ‚Äî Curriculum-related visuals  
- `src/components/Charts` ‚Äî Pie, Radar, TopBar charts  
- `src/components/Curriculum` ‚Äî Printable CV views and icons  
- `src/model.ts` ‚Äî Main curriculum data model with experience, skills, industry, and role computation  
- `src/types.ts` ‚Äî Type definitions for experiences and skills  
- `deploy.sh` ‚Äî Custom SSH deployment script  
- `tailwind.config.js` ‚Äî Color palette used for skill heatmaps

## üß† Curriculum Generation Logic

The file `model.ts` defines:

- `workExperiences[]` ‚Äî A list of job entries with roles, skills, and impact  
- `skillsFromExperience[]` ‚Äî Aggregated skill scores based on time spent using each  
- `rolesFromExperience[]` ‚Äî Time-weighted role summaries  
- `industriesFromExperience[]` ‚Äî Time-weighted industry focus

These aggregates power dynamic chart visualizations.

## ü§ñ ChatGPT Integration

The project includes an AI-powered chat feature that allows visitors to ask questions about your experience and background.

### Setup

1. **Get an OpenAI API Key**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to create an API key
2. **Configure Environment Variable**: Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Restart Development Server**: The chat will automatically use the real ChatGPT API once configured

### Features

- **Header Chat Button**: "Ask AI" button appears in the header next to the PDF link
- **Context-Aware Responses**: The AI is trained on your specific background and experience
- **Fallback Mode**: Works without API key (simulated responses)
- **Print-Friendly**: Chat interface is hidden when printing
- **Dark Mode Support**: Adapts to your site's theme

### Customization

The AI context is defined in `src/services/chatgpt.ts`. You can modify the `SYSTEM_CONTEXT` to provide different information about your background.
